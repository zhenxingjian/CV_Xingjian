\section{RESEARCH \\ INTERESTS}
                My research interest is about different structured data for medical application in Computer Vision. Since it’s quite mature for Euclidean space machine learning, I would like to explore some different structured data or constrained data for classification. For example, the Symmetric Positive Definite matrix in medical data (DTI) or covariance matrix are the data with constraint. I would like to try some neural networks in Euclidean space and extend them to the manifold data, which is the structured data, to do the classification or regression. I believe this will be useful in diagnosis from a medical perspective or analysis the video/image information.
