\section{RESEARCH \\ INTERESTS}
                My research interest is about structured data or high-order features in Computer Vision. Since it's quite mature for Euclidean space deep learning, I would like to explore some different structured data or constrained data. The covariance matrices of the feature vectors can be viewed as the second-order features. Those high-order features are constrained by their own structure, i.e., Symmetric Positive Deﬁnite. Thus this will break the basic rules in Euclidean space. But those matrices are more robust to noise and contain more high-level information. I want to try some neural networks in Euclidean space, and extend them to those structured data.
